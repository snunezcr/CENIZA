Introduction
------------

Volcanic ash dispersion is common in the Pacific Rim. Various simulation models
exist for approximating how ash dispersion occurs. This package provides a new,
fresh attempt at a unified simulation implementation that can be extended and
allows for implementation of novel numerical models within its specification.

Also, special attention is given to parallelism. This software can be compiled
with or without support for OpenMP and MPI, or include any of those.
